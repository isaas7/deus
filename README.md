## s.cpp
- The `s.cpp` script is a versatile tool designed to facilitate the generation of a structured directory and file hierarchy for C++ projects. It harnesses the power of the C++ Standard Library, particularly the `<filesystem>` library, to dynamically create directories and files based on user-defined parameters. 

- At its core, the script generates a root directory containing three primary subdirectories: `src`, `inc`, and `tests`, which represent source files, header files, and test files, respectively. Users can specify the number of each type of file they wish to generate, allowing for tailored project setups that align with their specific development needs.

- Each generated file is pre-populated with a basic structure, ensuring that developers have a consistent starting point for their coding endeavors. The script includes robust error handling mechanisms that provide clear feedback in the event of any issues during the creation process, enhancing usability and debugging capabilities.

- Furthermore, the script is designed with cross-platform compatibility in mind, supporting both ARM and Intel architectures. By incorporating architecture-specific macros, it ensures that the script remains efficient and effective across different systems, adapting to the underlying hardware seamlessly.

- Overall, `s.cpp` serves as an essential utility for C++ developers, streamlining the initial setup of projects and enabling them to focus on what truly matters: writing code and building innovative solutions.
